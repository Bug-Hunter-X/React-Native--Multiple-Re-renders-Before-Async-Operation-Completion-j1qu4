This error occurs when using a component that has a complex state update or relies on asynchronous operations within its lifecycle methods.  The problem is that the component might re-render multiple times before the asynchronous operation is completed, leading to unexpected behavior and potential race conditions.  This commonly involves using `setState` within lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` while also fetching data or performing other asynchronous operations.  For example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  state = {
    data: null,
  };

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('some-api-endpoint')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => {
        this.setState({ data });
      });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.data) {
      return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    }

    return <Text>{this.state.data.someValue}</Text>;
  }
}
```

In this example, if the API request takes some time, the component might render multiple times before the `setState` call is executed.  Each render can potentially lead to an extra API call or other side effects leading to unwanted behavior and errors.
